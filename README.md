#Superficial White Matter (SWM) TBSS, ROI analysis, and Tractography


### Superficial White Matter Mask and Atlas 

Here I'll share superficial white matter (SWM) mask/atlases for use in TBSS or tractography analyses. The SWM mask is in MNI space and is created as described previously<sup>1</sup>.
